## Optimization Strategies Implemented

### 1. Comet-Native Prompt Structure
**Optimized Structure:**
```
COMET TRADING COMMAND
Execute buy order for AAPL on Coinbase.

Trading parameters:
â€¢ Action: BUY
â€¢ Symbol: AAPL
â€¢ Order type: MARKET
â€¢ Portfolio allocation: 2.0% of total account value

EXECUTION WORKFLOW:
â†’ Navigate to AAPL trading page
â†’ Select Buy option with real-time pricing
â†’ Calculate position size from account balance
â†’ Confirm trade with integrated verification

VOICE COMMAND: "Execute buy order for AAPL using 2.0% portfolio allocation on coinbase"
```

### 2. Voice-Command Friendly Format
- **Bullet points** instead of numbered lists
- **Action-oriented language** (execute, navigate, calculate)
- **Conversational tone** suitable for voice input
- **Single-sentence commands** that can be spoken naturally

### 3. Platform-Specific Enhancements

#### Coinbase (Comet Partnership Integration)
```
ðŸš€ COMET-OPTIMIZED for Coinbase Partnership:
Access live BTC data through Perplexity integration. Execute buy order:
â†’ Use built-in Coinbase market data for BTC price analysis
â†’ Navigate to Coinbase trading interface
â†’ Leverage Comet's autonomous execution for seamless order placement
```

#### Other Platforms (Optimized Workflows)
- **Streamlined navigation** with arrow notation (â†’)
- **Calculation formulas** embedded in prompts
- **Context-aware instructions** that leverage Comet's page understanding

### 4. Execution Checklist Integration
```
COMPLETION CHECKLIST:
âœ“ Verify symbol matches: AAPL
âœ“ Confirm order type: MARKET
âœ“ Validate allocation: 2.0% of portfolio
âœ“ Check order status and provide execution summary
```

### 5. Voice Command Ready
Each prompt includes a ready-to-use voice command:
```
VOICE COMMAND: "Execute buy order for AAPL using 2.0% portfolio allocation on coinbase"
```

## Best Practices for Comet Trading

### 1. Prompt Design
- Start with action verbs (Execute, Navigate, Calculate)
- Use conversational language that sounds natural when spoken
- Include context that Comet can understand from the current page
- Provide clear success criteria and verification steps

### 2. Platform Selection Priority
1. **Coinbase** - First choice due to official Perplexity partnership
2. **Robinhood** - Good mobile interface compatibility
3. **Fidelity/Schwab** - Traditional platforms with web interfaces
4. **IBKR** - Professional platform for advanced users

### 3. Error Handling
- Prompts include 2FA pause instructions
- Built-in verification steps before order submission
- Clear rollback procedures if errors occur

### 4. Security Considerations
- Never bypass security measures
- Always pause for user confirmation on 2FA
- Verify order details before submission
- Provide clear audit trail in completion reports

## Usage Examples

### Crypto Trading (Optimized)
```bash
python agentic-trader.py \
  --portfolio-type crypto \
  --horizon short \
  --platform coinbase \
